## Larger Outings

2.5 hours east of Seattle, the Enchantments are a series of alpine lakes and meadows located next to the Bavarian-themed town of Leavenworth. The 18-mile thru-hike is one of the most popular in the state, but there are also a number of shorter hikes. The hike to Colchuck Lake is recommended, and continuing up Aasgard Pass gives you a great view into the core Enchantments.

### Mt. Rainier National Park 🚗 🥾 🏔 ⛷️
If it is not cloudy, you can't miss it. Mt. Rainier is the tallest mountain in Washington and visible from almost anywhere. The park is only about 2.5 hours south of Seattle. You can make your day here as easy or hard as you want. Late June is still pretty snowy, so low elevation hikes in/near the park are the best bet if you want to keep your shoes dry. On the other hand, you can frequently still ski in the park through June.

### Olympic National Park 🚗 ⛴️ 🥾 🏔 🌲
Olympic National Park is located on the Olympic Peninsula, about 2 to 3 hours from Seattle. It feels closer since you spend the first hour riding a ferry and drinking coffee.

### North Cascades National Park 🚗 🥾 🏔 🏊
The North Cascades are located about 3 hours north of Seattle. The heavily glaciated park is home to some of the most rugged and remote terrain in the lower 48. It also offers casual swimming in teal blue glacial lakes.
