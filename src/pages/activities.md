## Local Attractions

### Discovery Park
Discovery Park is the largest park in Seattle and offers a variety of hiking trails, beaches, and views of the sound and
surrounding mountains. The park is home to a variety of wildlife, including bald eagles, seals, and sea lions.

### Seattle Center
The space needle, Chihuly garden of glass, and the museum of pop culture are all located at the seattle center. This 
is a great place to spend a day.

### Ballard Locks
The end of June should be a great time to visit the Ballard Locks and watch the salmon run. At the end of June, the 
chinook (king) salmon should be running, and you can watch them jump the fish ladder.

### Pike Place Market
Everybody has heard of the flying fish, but the market is also home to a variety of shops, restaurants, and street 
performers. Check it out!

### Center for Urban Horticulture
Our wedding venue is a great place to go for a walk through the wetlands. The
UW campus is also right across the street, which is a pretty place to poke around.

### Hot Tub Boats
This one is a bit trashy, but it is a lot of fun. You can rent a hot tub boat and cruise around Lake Union. This is a 
great rainy day activity.

### Washington Park Arboretum
The Washington Park Arboretum is a 230-acre park located on the shores of Lake Washington. Great place to go for a walk, 
run, or bike ride and pretty easy to get to via public transportation.

## Medium Outings

8 mile, 3k elevation: Mt. Washington has nice views of the sound and mountains. 
Located about 30 minutes east of Seattle on 90.
### Snow Lake
6 mile, 2k elevation: Snow Lake is a beautiful alpine lake located about an hour east of Seattle. The trail climbs out 
of Snoqualmie pass into a beautiful alpine basin.

## Larger Outings
### Enchantments
2.5 hours east of Seattle, the Enchantments are a series of alpine lakes and meadows located next to the Bavarian-themed
town of Leavenworth. The 18-mile thru-hike is one of the most popular in the state, but there are also a number of 
shorter hikes. I quite like the hike to Colchuck Lake, and have even hiked up there without a climbing objective. If you 
have some extra energy once you reach the lake, continuing up Aasgard pass gives you a great view into the core 
Enchantments.

### Mt. Rainier National Park
If it is not cloudy, you can't miss it. Mt. Rainier is the tallest mountain in Washington and visible from almost 
anywhere. It is also a lot closer than you might think. The park is only about 2.5 hours south of Seattle. You can 
make your day here as easy or hard as you want. Late june is still pretty snowy, so low elevation hikes in / near the 
park the best bet if you want to keep your shoes dry. On the other hand, you can frequently still ski in the park 
through June. So if you backcountry ski, heading up to camp Miur should be something to consider.

### Olympic National Park
Olympic National Park is located on the Olympic Peninsula. It is about 2 to 3 hours depending on where you go, but it 
feels much closer since you spend the first hour riding a ferry and drinking coffee. The park has temperate 
rainforests with some of the highest densities of bio mass in the world as well as rugged coastline strewn with 
old-growth driftwood.


### North Cascades National Park
The North Cascades are located about 3 hours north of Seattle. The park is home to some of the most rugged and 
remote terrain in the lower 48. It also offers casually swimming in teal blue glacial lakes.

## Further Afield

The San Juan Islands are a short ferry ride from Seattle and offer a variety of outdoor activities including kayaking,
whale watching, and hiking. The islands are also home to a number of charming towns and villages, as well as a variety of
restaurants and shops.

### Vancouver Island
Vancouver Island is a 4 hour ferry ride (or short sea plane ride) from Seattle. Victoria is a pretty city, or you can 
continue driving north to Tofino, the Sunshine Coast.

### Squamish
Just north of Vancouver, Squamish sits on the northern tip of the Howe Sound. The town is a popular destination for 
mountain bikers, climbers, and hikers.

### Juneau Alaska
Alaska's capital city is a short 2-hour flight from Seattle. Juneau is the capital of alaska and home to the mendanhall 
glacier (the thickest in the world). Whale watching, brown bear viewing, hiking, and helicopter tours are all popular here.
